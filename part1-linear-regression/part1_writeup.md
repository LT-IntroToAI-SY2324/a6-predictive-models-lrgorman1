1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model?
R^2 is the correlation of the x value to the y value and the lower the less correlation and vice versa.
2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?
137.7
3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
I think this is fairly accurate but may have some faults because in does not account for lifestyle factors or a condition that may tamper with someones blood pressure
