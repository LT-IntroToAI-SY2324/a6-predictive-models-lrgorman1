# Project - Create your own predictive model

Predictive models are used across industries to analyze and make predictions about data. From sports to beauty products to app usage, predictive models provide individuals and businesses with data to make informed decisions.

Throughout this module, you have learned how to program both supervised and unsupervised learning models. In this final project, you will create your own! Throughout this project, you will work through activities to complete the following steps:

1. Choose a dataset.
2. Determine which algorithm is the best fit. Based on the dataset you choose, you will need to figure out which algorithm to use. This will require you to get to know your data and your goals! Is there a linear correlation between variables? Are you looking for numerical value or a label/category? Do you know the labels or do you need the model to create them for you?
- Do some tests with matplotlib and visualize your data.  Does it provide a good correlation?  Why or why not?
3. Program your model. Once you have chosen your type of model, itâ€™s time to create it! In this step, you will write a program that fits your chosen model to the data. Your program and output will be specific to the model you choose.  
4. Analyze and present your findings. An important part of creating predictive models is being able to communicate the results. In this final step of the project, you will present your findings using slides or an infographic. Your product should include the following components:
- Your reasoning for the algorithm you chose
We chose to do a linear model as we belave the relationship btwn current placment, club market value and future placemtns is linear
- An explanation and analysis of the output of your model: What results did your model produce? What do they mean?
Our model unfourtantly did not work. If it did work out goal was to take into acount a teams market value and currenct postion to try to predirct their final postion next season.
- A prediction based on your model
if our model worked an exmaple of a prediction would be machester city were the most expeisve club and are currenly first then they will be preddicted to finish first.
- A summary of the accuracy of your model
If our model worked it would be somewhat accurate. The main issue is there are a lot of facotrs that go into where a team will finish. I beleve our model would only be off by up to 5 positons and ussalyt off by 2 maybe 3.
- Real world implications
This can be used to predict the placment of teams in any soccer league with some few changes based on their current postion and club market value. Our model does not work.
