# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
The addition of testing the model by looping through all of the values gave me trouble with successfully allowing it to execute a comparison between every prediction and actual value.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
It gives us the correlation between the line of best fit and the data


3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
I would say that its pretty accurate and that it shows a clear direction of progress with correlating data.
